# Mahendra Dani's Portfolio website

## Introduction
In modern times, we overcome across websites that are developed so accurately that the user is attracted to both it's contents and graphical user interface(GUI). 

This is achieved by using __programming languages__ like
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Javascrpit ES6

and __Frameworks__ like
- Bootstrap
- MongoDB
- Node.js
- Express.js
- React.js
- etc.

Websites developed using these technology are filled with eye catching styling, navigation menus, drop-downs, graphics , animations, etc.

## Context
In 1980s when most of the above mentioned technologies either didn't existed or were under development, only HTML was used to create website. Those webistes developed were full of texts, hyperlinks , tables, lists and a few more properties only. They didn't had the GUI as we see these days. 

- For example, when Google was established in 1988 their webiste looked like this [Google](https://elgoog.im/google1998/)

It is interesting to see that the Professors like [Thomas H. Cormen](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/), [Jhon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/) and [Donald E. Knuth](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/) who are among the best professors and scientistss in Computer Science have simple websites developed without using any complex technolgies or frameworks other than HTML, which still look like those in the 1980s.

## My Portfolio Website
